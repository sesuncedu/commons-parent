This file is also used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the 
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
SVN commits. TBA how to use this with SVN.

To generate the release notes from this file:

mvn changes:announcement-generate
then tweak the formatting if necessary 
and commit

The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.

    Starting with version 22, the RAT plugin has changed Maven group and id, so any existing configuration
    needs to be updated.
    To fix component POMs, please change any occurrences of:
        &lt;groupId>org.codehaus.mojo&lt;/groupId>
        &lt;artifactId>rat-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId>
    to the new values:
        &lt;groupId>org.apache.rat&lt;/groupId>
        &lt;artifactId>apache-rat-plugin&lt;/artifactId>
        </intro>
    </properties>

    <!-- NOTE: 
    The description below is specially formatted so as to improve the layout of the generated release notes:
    The parsing process removes all line feeds, replacing them with a single space.
    The Velocity template in resources/templates has been enhanced to replace pairs of adjacent spaces
    with a new-line in the release notes. (These spaces are ignored when displaying HTML).
    If the output is not quite correct, check for invisible trailing spaces!
    
    N.B. The release notes template groups actions by type, and only extracts data for the current release.
    The changes report outputs actions in the order they appear in this file.
